## Introduction to Qiskit, PennyLane, and Jupyter Notebooks
In this first assignment, we'll take our first look into the quantum software stacks we'll be using throughout the semester (Qiskit and PennyLane). Additionally, we'll learn how to commit our Jupyter notebooks to GitHub directly from Google Colab.

First, we'll be looking at [Qiskit](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/guides). Luckily for us, Qiskit is very well documented and there are plenty of resources out there. I do encourage you to skim Qiskit's documentation. Either way, in this module, we'll be looking at Qiskit's basic syntax (defining circuits, qubits, measurements, &c.), visualizing results and analyzing them.

## Working on Google Colab

- Go to Google Colab and open a new notebook. Make sure you give your notebook an appropriate name.

- After you finish working on your notebook, make sure you upload a copy to your GitHub repository. To do this, under "File", select "Save a copy in GitHub".

- If it's your first time integrating Google Colab to GitHub, you'll be asked for permission. You can go ahead and grant permission.

- When you're saving your notebook to GitHub, make sure you clearly specify the appropriate folder within the repository. See how in my example, I'm uploading my notebook to the "assignment_1".
