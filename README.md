## QA_JFALLA
Welcome to Quantum Algorithms (QSEG 820)! This GitHub repository will serve as aid for our hands-on demos and practical exercises. The goal of this repository is to provide useful tips and coding practice for implementing some of the quantum algorithms you will be learning in class. While there are many software stacks for quantum computing, we will be focusing on two of the (currently) widely used ones: Qiskit and PennyLanne. Furthermore, we'll be using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for our Jupyter notebooks.

## Submission Guidelines
Each submission must be turned in as a directory in QA_&lt;FirstinitialLastname&gt;
.

Make sure to always include a README.md file for each submission. In this README.md file please include the names of the students you collaborated with or, if you decided to work alone, please state this too.

**Plots**: If the assignment calls for plots, the plots must be rendered with axis labels and captions. The caption should state what is being plotted (plot description) and why it is being plotted (what conclusions should the reader draw from the plot?)

**The notebook must be executable**: As the TA, I should be able to download the notebook and run it cell by cell without errors on Google Colab. If any data is being used, this data should also be made available to me. In general, you should be using conventional libraries. If an unusual library is used, this should be justified and indicated explictly in the README.md file, along with links to obtain the library if not available by *conda*, *pip*, or *brew install*.

If code from other sources is used, e.g. using a function found online, the resource must be stated, as a citation, in the notebook.

Adherence to coding style ([PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)) is highly encouraged.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.
