  ![new_repo](/getting_started/images/new_repo.png)

- Name your new repository QA_&lt;FirstinitialLastname&gt;. For example, my repository is QA_JFalla. Provide a brief description of the repository, and set its status to "Public". Finally, include a "README.md" file and Python for .gitignore template. (*Note that my repository's name is already taken, since I've gone ahead and created mine already*)

- In your README.md file please include a little intro to you: your name, your program and year at UD, and in a few words tell me how familiar you are with Qiskit and/or PennyLane, and with using Jupyter notebooks.
